- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently on a summer break which allows me to fuel and look at some LeetCode problems. Love to spend my time on learning new stuff. -->
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on Java, Scala, JavaScript/HMTL/CSS, C/C++, Python, C#, F#, and MySQL projects. Looking for friends who would work on a side project.
